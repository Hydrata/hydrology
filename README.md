# The Hydrata Hydrology App


![Actions Status](https://github.com/Hydrata/hydrology/workflows/pytest-hydrology/badge.svg?branch=4.1.x)

This app contains the basic hydrology functions used in hydrata.com

It consists of the following components:

## IFD Curves
Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves describe the characteristics of event-based rainfall at a given location on the planet. 

## Temporal Patterns
Temporal Patterns describe the timing of any rainfall volume during an event

## Timeseries
By combining IFD Curves and Temporal Patterns, a timeseries of rainfall is produced. This can be used as the inflow for a hydraulic model.
